# BitRealm Contributor's Guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **BitRealm**! Your ideas, feedback, and contributions help shape the game, and we truly appreciate your support. Whether you're reporting a bug, suggesting a new feature, or submitting code changes, here’s how you can get involved.

[Filing an Issue](#filing-an-issue) | [Fixes & Features](#contributing-fixes--features) | [Development](#development)

## Filing an Issue

Before diving into a fix or feature, it's always a good idea to **start with an issue**. This helps prevent duplicate work, ensures alignment with the project’s goals, and allows for discussion before you invest time in coding.

> [!TIP] 
> **Not sure if it's a bug, a feature request, or just a question?** No worries — go ahead and file an issue! We're happy to help figure it out.

### When to File an Issue

-   **Found a bug?** Let us know by opening an issue with details.
-   **Have a question?** If it's not covered in the documentation, feel free to ask!
-   **Got an idea for a new feature?** We'd love to hear it!
-   **Not sure if something is already being worked on?** A quick search might help, but if in doubt, just ask!

### Indicating Interest in Issues

If you find an existing issue that matches yours, instead of creating a duplicate, you can:

-   **Upvote** the issue by clicking the 👍 reaction.
-   **Add useful details** (such as steps to reproduce or additional context).

Avoid "+1" or "me too" comments, as they clutter discussions — use reactions instead!

## Contributing Fixes & Features

It doesn't matter if it's a bug fix, a new BitRealm or just a small change. Every contribution is welcome.

### What do I have to consider?

> [!TIP]
> Before you start to work on fixing an issue or adding a new feature please comment on [Would you like to contribute to BitRealm]() thread to let me, and other contributors, know you're interested in working on something. This helps avoid multiple people unexpectedly working on the same thing and ensures everyone is clear on what should be done. It's less work for everyone to establish this up front.

-   Please let us know by commenting in [this thread]() **linking to the issue** and linking to the issue you'd like to work on. We will get back to you as soon as possible.
-   Wait until we say you're good to work on the issue, as we don't want to reject your contribution, if we don't think it fits BitRealm, after you've already done all the work.

### Where can I find good issues to contribute to?

Searching for issues having a [help-wanted]() or a [good first issue]() labels will show you some that we consider easy for beginners.

### Where can I find more information on the source code?

Most if not all functions and classes are docummented via JSDoc and comments. There are also [soon to come developer docs]().

If you have any further questions don't hesitate to ask them on the issue thread of the issue you're working on.

## Development

> [!NOTE]
> Both developer docs and developer guidelines are yet to be finished so for the time being the only source of information regarding the source code are JSDocs and comments. If you have any questions feel free to open an issue.

Follow the [development guidelines]().

### Naming Features and Functionality

Names should be descriptive and straightforward, clearly reflecting functionality and usefulness.
