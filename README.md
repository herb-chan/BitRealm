## Clone & Run Locally:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before running the game, you need to have Node.js installed. You can download it from the official website: [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

Open a terminal and clone the repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/herb-chan/BitRealm
cd BitRealm
```

> [!TIP]
> Currently, BitRealm does not use any external npm packages. However, this may change in the future, so make sure you run `npm i` in your terminal before running the server.

After you've cloned the project, you can start the game server by running the following command:

```sh
node server.js
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and go to: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

> [!NOTE]
> This will start a local server. If port 3000 is unavailable, the server will automatically select an available port.
